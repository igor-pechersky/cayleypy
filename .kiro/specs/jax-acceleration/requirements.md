# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds JAX support for GPU/TPU acceleration to CayleyPy, enabling significant performance improvements for large-scale graph operations. JAX provides just-in-time (JIT) compilation, automatic differentiation, and vectorization capabilities that can dramatically accelerate tensor operations, hash computations, and search algorithms on GPU and TPU hardware.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher working with large Cayley graphs, I want to leverage GPU/TPU acceleration for BFS operations, so that I can compute growth functions and explore larger graph structures in reasonable time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has JAX installed and GPU/TPU hardware available THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and utilize the accelerated backend for BFS operations
2. WHEN running BFS on GPU/TPU THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 5x speedup compared to CPU-only numba implementations for graphs with >10^6 states
3. WHEN JAX is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to existing CPU implementations without errors
4. WHEN memory constraints are exceeded on GPU THEN the system SHALL implement chunked processing to handle larger datasets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner using beam search for pathfinding, I want JAX-accelerated tensor operations, so that I can process larger beam widths and achieve faster convergence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing beam search with JAX acceleration THEN the system SHALL support beam widths up to 10^6 states efficiently
2. WHEN computing hash functions for duplicate detection THEN JAX implementations SHALL provide at least 10x speedup over CPU implementations
3. WHEN running vectorized operations on state batches THEN the system SHALL utilize JAX's vmap for automatic vectorization
4. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL implement memory-efficient chunked operations to prevent OOM errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating CayleyPy into my application, I want seamless JAX integration, so that I can choose between CPU, GPU, and TPU backends without changing my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JAX is available THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration option to enable/disable JAX acceleration
2. WHEN switching between backends THEN the API SHALL remain consistent with existing CayleyGraph methods
3. WHEN JAX operations fail THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings and fall back to CPU implementations
4. WHEN running tests THEN all existing functionality SHALL work correctly with both JAX and non-JAX backends

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want optimized JAX implementations for core operations, so that I can achieve maximum throughput on available hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing matrix multiplications THEN JAX implementations SHALL utilize optimized BLAS libraries and hardware-specific optimizations
2. WHEN computing unique elements and set operations THEN JAX implementations SHALL provide efficient alternatives to numpy operations
3. WHEN running on TPU hardware THEN the system SHALL implement TPU-specific optimizations for maximum performance
4. WHEN processing permutation operations THEN JAX implementations SHALL maintain numerical precision equivalent to CPU versions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing algorithm performance, I want benchmarking tools for JAX acceleration, so that I can measure and compare performance across different hardware configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL provide timing comparisons between CPU, GPU, and TPU implementations
2. WHEN measuring memory usage THEN the system SHALL report memory consumption for different batch sizes and operations
3. WHEN testing scalability THEN benchmarks SHALL demonstrate performance characteristics across different problem sizes
4. WHEN validating correctness THEN benchmarks SHALL verify that JAX implementations produce identical results to CPU versions
