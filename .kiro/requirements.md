# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CayleyPy is a Python library for analyzing extremely large state-space graphs, particularly Cayley graphs and Schreier coset graphs. The library represents combinatorial puzzles and mathematical structures as graphs where vertices are group elements (states) and edges represent group generators (valid moves). This mathematical foundation enables efficient analysis of puzzles with astronomical state spaces that cannot be stored in memory, such as Rubik's Cube with approximately 4.3Ã—10^19 states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Graph Definition and State Space Representation

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to define puzzles and combinatorial structures as Cayley graphs using mathematical group theory, so that I can analyze their properties using rigorous mathematical foundations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a puzzle is defined using permutation generators, THE SYSTEM SHALL create a CayleyGraphDef with GeneratorType.PERMUTATION that represents states as permutations and moves as permutation operations
2. WHEN a puzzle is defined using matrix generators, THE SYSTEM SHALL create a CayleyGraphDef with GeneratorType.MATRIX that represents states as matrices and moves as matrix multiplication operations
3. WHEN generators are provided for a puzzle, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate that permutation generators are valid permutations and matrix generators are square matrices of consistent dimensions
4. WHEN a central state is specified, THE SYSTEM SHALL use it as the reference point for all graph computations, defaulting to the identity element if not provided
5. WHEN generators form an inverse-closed set, THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically detect this property and optimize algorithms accordingly

### Requirement 2: Efficient State Space Exploration

**User Story:** As a puzzle solver, I want to explore large state spaces efficiently without running out of memory, so that I can analyze puzzles with millions or billions of states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing breadth-first search on a graph, THE SYSTEM SHALL explore states layer by layer while maintaining configurable memory limits to prevent system crashes
2. WHEN the state space is too large to store completely, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide options to store only specific layers (first, last, or layers below a size threshold)
3. WHEN exploring states, THE SYSTEM SHALL use efficient hash-based deduplication to avoid revisiting previously seen states
4. WHEN memory usage approaches configured limits, THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically trigger garbage collection and memory cleanup procedures
5. WHEN generators are inverse-closed, THE SYSTEM SHALL optimize memory usage by storing only the last two layers of visited states during BFS
